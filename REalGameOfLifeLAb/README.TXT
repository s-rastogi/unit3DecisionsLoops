Requirements Documents:
* My grid will be 15x15
* The live cells will be rock and the dead cells will be empty spaces.
* The pattern intiially is a diamond and before all itereations will complety die off. This is all chosen by me.
* The game will run for 15 iterations, so it will not run forever.The time interval is 1000 meaning 1 second.
* One a cell reaches the edge, it dies. The game will not wrap around.

I really enjoyed the process of the lab, it was a lot more interesting to learn something by ourselfs and applying it compared to just sitting there and coding.  However i disliked some of small things like making the grids because submitting it was very hard and i still do notknow how to do it. 
It was surprising how deep i got into the lab when i started working, usually i can not stay focused but because it was very interesting it had my complete attention.
also i had always thought these sort of things were much more elaborate but it turns out its easier than it seems.
Are we going to do any labs similiar to this?
Advice: spend your time wisely and work on it a little every day instead of playing games and going on reddit
